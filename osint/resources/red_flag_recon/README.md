# Details
Since announcing GreyCTF, we've noticed persistent comments on the GreyHats Instagram account from a user keen to create a challenge for us. But with GreyCTF so close to our final exams, we haven't had the bandwidth to properly vet him. Help us check him out, make sure there are no red flags.

Note: There is only one flag in this challenge. If it fits the flag format `grey{...}`, you've likely got it!

# Hints

Like Truffles, some secrets are hidden just beneath the surface. Just got to sniff them out.

# Learning objectives

An obscure (but intended) behaviour of github repositories is that making a private repo public exposes all commits made in ANY repository in the fork network. This can result in leaked API keys or other secrets when done incorrectly.
