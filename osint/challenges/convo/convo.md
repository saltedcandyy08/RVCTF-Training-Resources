# Challenge Description
We have intercepted a transmission between OIU and a mysterious Z*****N!
Can you help figure out where OIU is staying?

# Solve
We are given a screenshot of a chat between OIU and Z, however, we are only able to see what OIU is saying.

Let's first try and get as much details as possible from the chat.

1. Good view, in the city
2. 2h from Muar (Malaysia) -> Country could be either Singapore/Malaysia
3. Find places displaying 100 haute couture pieces -> searching for ""over 100 haute couture"" *WITH the quotation marks!* would give results of ArtScience museum/Iris van herpen exhibits. Searching without the quotation marks will give somewhat related results, but nothing about SG or Malaysia
4. Unique roof with city view, expensive -> Singpore city centre? MBS comes to mind
