An oddly protected archive was found stuffed at the bottom of a stocking. No tag. No label. Just a message that clearly did not come from around here.

Santa swears it isn’t his, the elves deny everything, and the reindeer are not talking.

Crack open the archive, recover the message, and figure out where it originally came from. The flag is tied to the true origin of the message.

flag format: YBN25{the_istana}
